            <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Rewired Imagination is a product from <a
                href="http://rewiredstate.org">Rewired State</a>,
                built on the <a
                href="https://rewiredreality.com">Rewired Reality</a>
                functionality.</p>

            <h3>Standard description</h3>
                <p>Rewired Imagination is an online ideation platform
                allowing ideas to be generated, critiqued,
                peer-reviewed, and ultimately judged, by anyone able
                to access the website. Competition is integral to the
                way it's been designed.</p>

                <p>We understand the importance of domain knowledge
                experts, as well as challenge-raisers wanting to score
                submissions against given criteria, providing tools
                for both.</p>

                <p>To take things forward, there's an easy method to
                take the brief, and winning entries forward via <a
                href="https://rewiredreality.com">Rewired Reality</a>,
                or into a Rewired State hack day.</p>
