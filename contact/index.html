                <h2>Contact us</h2> 
                    <p>We'd love to hear from you. The easiest way for
                    us is via <a
                    href="mailto:hello@rewiredimagination.com">email</a>,
                    but we can also respond via <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/rewiredimagine">Twitter</a>.</p>

                    <p>If you'd like to chat with us in real-time, please
                    send a calendar invitation to <a

                    and we'll see what we can do (as G-chat's now been
