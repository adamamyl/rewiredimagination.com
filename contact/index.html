                <h2>Contact us</h2> 
                    <p>We'd love to hear from you. The easiest way for
                    us is via <a
                    href="mailto:hello@rewiredimagination.com">email</a>,
                    but we can also respond via <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/rewiredimagine">Twitter</a>.</p>

                    <p>If you'd like to chat with us in real-time, please
                    send a calendar invitation to <a
                    href="mailto:adam@rewiredimagination.com">adam@rewiredimagination.com</a>,
                    and we'll see what we can do (as G-chat's now been
                    phased out).</p>

                    <p>If you'd like to meet us, please make an appointment; usually we're based off the Strand, on Adam Street (WC2N 6LE).</p>

                    <p>Our registered address, in the unlikely case that you need it is:
                    <address>
                        Rewired State Ltd.<br />
